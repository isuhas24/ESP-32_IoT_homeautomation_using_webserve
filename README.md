The ESP-32 can act as a Wi-Fi station,as an access point, or both.In most projects we see ESP-32 connected to a wireless router but in here i am gonna show you how to set ESP-32 as an access point.When the ESP-32 is connected to a wireless router,the router acts as an access point and the ESP-32 is set as as a station.In this scenario, we need to connect our router(local network) to control the ESP-32.But if we set the ESP-32 as an access point(hotspot),we can connect ESP-32 using any device with WiFi capabilities without the need to connect to the router.In simple words, when we set the ESP-32 as an access point we create its own WiFi network and nearby devices can connect to to it(like smartphone or computer).We are gonna use Arduino IDE to program the ESP-32.Refer to the code mentioned in the repository.Just upload the code to the ESP-32 to set it as an access point.We will have to define a SSID name an a password to access the ESP-32.We can set the SSID and password to whatever we want.
